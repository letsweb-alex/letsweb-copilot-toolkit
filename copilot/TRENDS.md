# Letsweb Trend Filter

When evaluating solutions:
- Prefer tools, patterns, and approaches that gained adoption in the last 3–5 years
- Prefer pragmatic startup choices over enterprise frameworks
- If something is "industry standard", explain:
  - who uses it now
  - and why it is still relevant

Explicitly call out:
- outdated patterns
- cargo-cult architecture
- solutions kept only due to inertia

If a legacy approach is recommended:
- justify it clearly
